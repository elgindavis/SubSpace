# SubSpace
CS50 Final Project, partnered with Jack Kelley

SubSpace was created to allow students to access the college's events calendar and the unique ability to
submit events to be added locally, as well as access to a Google campus map to locate the events. 
Students can now stay on top of all of Harvard's events, while also creating and sharing their own
events within the student body that they don't necessarily want to publicize on mainstream media, like Facebook for example.
It is located in my cs50 ide at https://ide50-elgindavis.cs50.io/homepage.html.
In SubSpace, first a user must register with a username and password. They are then logged in
to their account and can access the official Harvard events calendar, as well as a 
Google map centered at Harvard University. The user can also submit an event to us for review
which is sent to our mysql database. The event field holds an event name, date, time, location, and description, 
We then go through the the events and manually add them to the local calendar for SubSpace users to access. 
The about section describes the site briefly.
